# Machine-Learning-Projects
In this repository, will be showcased some machine learning projects in Python.

1. Magic Dataset.
   
   The first machine learning model is utilizing the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset.

2. Bike Dataset.

   This machine learning moddel is on the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset.

3. seeds Dataset.

   An application of K-means on a high-dimensional dataset and dimensionality reduction using PCA.

4. MNIST Dataset.

   In this notebook, we check out how effective are the Convolutional Neural Networks and their accuracy (almost 99%).

5. Natural Language Processing.

   In this notebook, we tackle a NLP problem with the usage of BERT and word embeddings.
